# ServiceLogMonitor
monitors log files for errors/exceptions and mails alert
This LogMonitory project was created to help with the troubleshooting and fixing of issues in applications. As most applications store a lot of information on exceptions/errors in their log files, having a LogMonitor that emails you an alert when an exception has occured with a timestamp will cut down immensely on time and effort for a developer to solve the problem that he would otherwise spend searching through a log file or waiting for an end user/support member to notify him of said issue.
This project consists of three main classes:
LogFileEmulator
LogFileMonitor
ExceptionAlertMailer

The LogFileEmulator is an optional component as it's job is to create and mimic a log file of a service or application. It will continuously write to a text file some data and occasionally output an Exception.

The LogFileMonitor implements the Apache Commons Tailer class to continuously read the tail of the log file generated by LogFileEmulator and calls ExceptionAlertMailer when text containing the string "exception" is found.

ExceptionAlertMailer is a simple implementation of Java mail using GMail SMTP. It is configured to send an email alert containing the exception text in the log file from one of my gmail accounts to another.
